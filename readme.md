After clone this project. All you need to do is execute this command below

```
make server
```

make sure you install Makefile first

but if you wont install Make file, execute this command from root directory

```
cd cmd && go run main.go
```

This project already has database migration, and it will auto migrate when the server start
Please let me know if there any problem or question. 

Best Regard,
Aditya Tegar
